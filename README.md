This is my first README. How cool is that

Okay, so far we have learned how to use HTML and what the different pieces of basic HTML code are. 
    Elements are the pieces of actual HTML code
    Tags are used to show what type of element a particular line of code is
    Attributes are placed inside the opening tag and are used to attribute additional information to the element

    Also we've learned how to use git and the command line/terminal 

This project consists of making a website that will have a variety of recipes. 
My Plan is to have a homepage showcasing the 3 recipes with images of the dishes
Clicking on either the image or the title of the dish will link to the recipe page
The recipe page will have an overview of the recipe 
    Season/Type/Length/Servings/Prep Time/Difficulty
    Unordered List of ingredients 
After the overview will be the recipe itself with instructions 
    I want to add 1 link per recipe to an instructional video for a step - ex:fine slicing onions
    Instructions will be an ordered list
To close the recipe I want to include a different image from homepage showing the dish
