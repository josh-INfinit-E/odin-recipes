            <li>1 can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2/3 cups pimiento-stuffed green olives, drained and chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup capers, drained</li>
            <li>1/4 cup golden raisins</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 pinch oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the potatoes into a large pot with enough water to cover; season with salt. Bring the water to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the pot, and cook the potatoes at a simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat; cook and stir the onion, green bell pepper, and garlic in the hot oil until the vegetables soften, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Crumble the ground beef into the onion mixture, breaking the meat into smaller pieces as you mix; cook and stir until the beef is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain as much fat from the mixture as possible.</li>
            <li>tir the red wine, tomato sauce, olives, capers, golden raisins, cumin, oregano, black pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon salt into the ground beef mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the <a href =https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(cooking)>wine had reduced significantly</a>, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Peel the cooled potatoes and cut into chunks</li>
            <li>Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the potatoes in the hot oil until browned, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Gently fold the cooked potatoes into the simmering ground beef mixture; cook together 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
